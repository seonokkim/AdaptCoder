# AdaptCoder: Adaptive Code Generation and Efficient Debugging Agents with LLMs
AdaptCoder is a dynamic debugging framework designed to enhance code generation in large language models through adaptive iteration and targeted test generation. By segmenting code into smaller blocks and using runtime feedback, it generates edge cases from failed tests, guiding precise debugging steps and refining implementations based on observed patterns. This adaptive method improves debugging accuracy and leads to more reliable code generation.



## Work in Progress ðŸš§
This project is currently under active development. New features, enhancements, and fixes are being added frequently, but it may still contain incomplete functionality or areas under construction.
